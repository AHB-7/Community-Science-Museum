                        community. You can also support us by donating items of
                        interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some
                        item or collection that you think others would enjoy,
                        please let us know by contacting our Collections

                        A number of people volunteer their time and effort to
                        keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors
                        to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including
                        getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum,
                        access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where
                        all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
                        for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
                        can help volunteer in a number of different spheres.
                        Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about
                        how you can get involved.
